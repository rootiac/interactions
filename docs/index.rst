Welcome
=======

Hello there! Welcome to the official documentation of our library
extension made for discord.py: being able to use Discord Slash Commands.

Before we start going into the advanced stuff, it is highly recommended
to check out the `quickstart`_ page first from here or below in the contents.

If there are any questions that you have about the documentation
of this library extension that the docs do not currently cover over, please
feel free to reach out to others on the `Discord`_!
